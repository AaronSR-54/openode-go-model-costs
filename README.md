## Features

- Shows relative cost per model (`1.0x`, `2.3x`, `10x`, etc.) compared to the cheapest model
- Color-coded: green (≤1.5x), yellow (≤5x), red (>5x)
- Marks models released in the last 30 days as `(recent)`
- Highlights the currently active model
- Toggle sidebar visibility via `/toggle-costs`

## Install

Add to your `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["model-costs"]
}
```

Restart opencode and the sidebar will appear automatically.

## Usage

- **Toggle**: Run `/toggle-costs` to show/hide the sidebar
- **Colors**: Green = cheap, Yellow = moderate, Red = expensive
- **Recent**: Models with `(recent)` tag were released in the last 30 days
